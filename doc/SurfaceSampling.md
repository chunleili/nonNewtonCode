# SurfaceSampling

A popular boundary handling method which is also implemented in SPlisHSPlasH uses a particle sampling of the surfaces of all boundary objects. This command line tool can generate such a surface sampling. Note that the same surface sampling is also integrated in the simulators and the samplings are generated automatically if they are required. However, if you want to generate a surface sampling manually, then you can use this tool.
